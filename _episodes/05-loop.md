**Loops** are key to productivity improvements through automation as they allow us to execute
commands repetitively. Similar to wildcards and tab completion, using loops also reduces the
amount of typing (and typing mistakes).

Let's do something on all the images.

We would like to modify these files, but also save a version of the original files, naming the copies
`original-1411.jpg` and so on.
We can't use:

~~~
$ cp *.jpg original-*.jpg
~~~
{: .bash}

because that would expand to:

~~~
$ cp 1141.dat 1142.dat original-*.jpg
~~~
{: .bash}

This wouldn't back up our files, instead we get an error:

~~~
cp: target `original-*.jpg' is not a directory
~~~
{: .error}

This problem arises when `cp` receives more than two inputs. When this happens, it
expects the last input to be a directory where it can copy all the files it was passed.
Since there is no directory named `original-*.jpg` in the `pictures` directory we get an
error.

Instead, we can use a **loop**
to do some operation once for each thing in a list.
Here's a simple example that displays the first three lines of each file in turn:

~~~
$ for filename in 1411.jpg 1412.jpg
> do
>    echo $filename
> done
~~~
{: .bash}

When the shell sees the keyword `for`,
it knows to repeat a command (or group of commands) once for each thing `in` a list.
For each iteration,
the name of the each thing is sequentially assigned to
the **variable** and the commands inside the loop are executed before moving on to 
the next thing in the list.
Inside the loop,
we call for the variable's value by putting `$` in front of it.
The `$` tells the shell interpreter to treat
the **variable** as a variable name and substitute its value in its place,
rather than treat it as text or an external command. 

In this example, the list is two filenames: `1411.jpg` and `1412.jpg`.
Each time the loop iterates, it will assign a file name to the variable `filename`
and run the `head` command.
The first time through the loop,
`$filename` is `1141.jpg`. 
The interpreter runs the command `echo` on `1141.jpg`, 
and the prints the string `1141.jpg`.
For the second iteration, `$filename` becomes 
`1142.jpg`. This time, the shell runs `echo` on `1142.jpg`
and prints `1142.jpg`. 
Since the list was only two items, the shell exits the `for` loop.

When using variables it is also
possible to put the names into curly braces to clearly delimit the variable
name: `$filename` is equivalent to `${filename}`, but is different from
`${file}name`. You may find this notation in other people's programs.

{: .callout}

We have called the variable in this loop `filename`
in order to make its purpose clearer to human readers.
The shell itself doesn't care what the variable is called;
if we wrote this loop as:

~~~
for x in 1141.jpg 1142.jpg
do
    echo $x
done
~~~
{: .bash}

or:

~~~
for temperature in 1141.jpg 1142.jpg
do
    echo $temperature
done
~~~
{: .bash}

it would work exactly the same way.
*Don't do this.*
Programs are only useful if people can understand them,
so meaningless names (like `x`) or misleading names (like `temperature`)
increase the odds that the program won't do what its readers think it does.

{: .callout}

Going back to our original file copying problem,
we can solve it using this loop:

~~~
for filename in *.jpg
do
    cp $filename original-$filename
done
~~~
{: .bash}

This loop runs the `cp` command once for each filename.
The first time,
when `$filename` expands to `1141.jpg`,
the shell executes:

~~~
cp 1141.jpg original-1141.jpg
~~~
{: .bash}

The second time, the command is:

~~~
cp 1142.jpg original-1142.jpg
~~~
{: .bash}

Since the `cp` command does not normally produce any output, it's hard to check 
that the loop is doing the correct thing. By prefixing the command with `echo` 
it is possible to see each command as it _would_ be executed. The following diagram 
shows what happens when the modified script is executed, and demonstrates how the 
judicious use of `echo` is a good debugging technique.

## Nelle's Pipeline: Processing Files

Add additonal metadata to the file names more descriptive.
Let's say we're interested in catagorizing the images by whether
they were origionally mounted in a glass enclosure.  This
is noted in the slide condition field.  We'll add the letter 'G' to slides that had the enclosuer
and 'N' if they did not.  We'll use 'X' instead if there was uneven dye fading.
1411,1143,1148,1149 get G
1142 gets X
Everything else gets N

There is probably a more efficient strategy - but
start mby appending N to all files with.  Then manually change the others to G and X.

Nelle is now ready to process her data files.
Since she's still learning how to use the shell,
she decides to build up the required commands in stages.
Her first step is to make sure that she can select the right files --- remember,
these are ones whose names end in 'G' or 'N', rather than 'X'. Starting from her home directory, Nelle types:

~~~
$ cd photos/19
$ for datafile in *[GN].jpg
> do
>     echo $datafile
> done
~~~
{: .bash}

Her next step is to decide
what to call the files that the `imagestats` analysis program will create.
Prefixing each input file's name with "stats" seems simple,
so she modifies her loop to do that:

~~~
$ for datafile in *[GN].jpg
> do
>     echo $datafile stats-$datafile.txt
> done
~~~
{: .bash}

She hasn't actually run `imagestats` yet,
but now she's sure she can select the right files and generate the right output filenames.

Typing in commands over and over again is becoming tedious,
though,
and Nelle is worried about making mistakes,
so instead of re-entering her loop,
she presses the up arrow.
In response,
the shell redisplays the whole loop on one line
(using semi-colons to separate the pieces):

~~~
$ for datafile in *[GN].jpg; do echo $datafile stats-$datafile.txt; done
~~~
{: .bash}

Using the left arrow key,
Nelle backs up and changes the command `echo` to `bash imagestats`:

~~~
$ for datafile in *[GN].jpg; do bash imagestats $datafile stats-$datafile.txt; done
~~~
{: .bash}

When she presses Enter,
the shell runs the modified command.
However, nothing appears to happen --- there is no output.
After a moment, Nelle realizes that since her script doesn't print anything to the screen any longer,
she has no idea whether it is running, much less how quickly.
She kills the running command by typing `Ctrl-C`,
uses up-arrow to repeat the command,
and edits it to read:

~~~
$ for datafile in *[GN].txt; do echo $datafile; bash imagestats $datafile stats-$datafile; done
~~~
{: .bash}

> ## Beginning and End
>
> We can move to the beginning of a line in the shell by typing `Ctrl-A`
> and to the end using `Ctrl-E`.
{: .callout}

When she runs her program now,
it produces one line of output every five seconds or so:

1518 times 5 seconds,
divided by 60,
tells her that her script will take about two hours to run.
As a final check,
she opens another terminal window,
goes into `north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03`,
and uses `cat stats-NENE01729B.txt`
to examine one of the output files.
It looks good,
so she decides to get some coffee and catch up on her reading.

> ## Those Who Know History Can Choose to Repeat It
>

> get a list of the last few hundred commands that have been executed, and
> then to use `!123` (where "123" is replaced by the command number) to

>
> ~~~
> $ history | tail -n 5
> ~~~
> {: .bash}
> ~~~
>   456  ls -l NENE0*.txt
>   457  rm stats-NENE01729B.txt.txt
>   458  bash imagestats NENE01729B.txt stats-NENE01729B.txt
>   459  ls -l NENE0*.txt
>   460  history
> ~~~
> {: .output}
>
> then she can re-run `imagestats` on `NENE01729B.txt` simply by typing
> `!458`.
{: .callout}

> `less !$` to look at the file `stats-NENE01729B.txt`, which is
> quicker than doing up-arrow and editing the command-line.
